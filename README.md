# 3xplus1-benchmark
A simple benchmark written in different languages

Made by DuckyBlender (C, Python, C++, Rust) and RilaxYT 
(C# is in .NET v6, Java 8)

Current speeds (will add exact results later):
1. Java (0.277s)
3. Rust (0.497s)
5. Python (22.9s)

Untested:
- C
- C++
- C# (pretty fast on online compilers)
