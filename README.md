# 3xplus1-benchmark

A simple benchmark written in different languages
It calculates the first one milion digits of the The Collatz Conjecture

Made by DuckyBlender (C, Python, C++, Rust) and RilaxYT
(C# is in .NET v6, Java 8)

## THE PYTHON SCRIPT WHICH EXECUTES ALL BENCHMARKS IS IN VERY EARLY STAGES AND DOES NOT WORK

Current speeds (will add exact results later):

1. Java (0.277s)
2. C (0.373s)
3. Rust (0.497s)
4. Python (22.9s)

Untested:

- C++
- C# (pretty fast on online compilers)
